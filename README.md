## Exploding Firework Street View Greeting Card

As the name says, this creates a greeting card that, when you click the button, creates exploding fireworks above the building / house of your choosing from Google Street View.

To use, just replace the street view embed code in the body with the embed code of your choosing. You might also want to change the ``body`` color from ``white`` to ``black`` depending on the color of the sky / building in street view.
